# Linux Device Driver Coding Model Evaluation System

This project benchmarks AI-generated Linux device driver code using automated scoring, static analysis, and compilation checks.

### ðŸš€ Features
- Compilation success & error detection
- Static analysis for kernel programming patterns
- `clang-tidy` style & bug checks
- Scoring rubric based on correctness, security, code quality, performance

### ðŸ§  Use Case
Use this to evaluate how well LLMs like GPT or Code Llama can write Linux kernel device drivers.
